# ğŸ”¶ CleanArchitecture.Template

# ğŸ”¶ Disclaimer
This is an open source project with the purpose of implement a simple Backend template project using **Clean Architecture** and **Domain Driven Design** principles.
My goal is to improve this source code everytime I learn something new about DDD and Clean Architecture. As I said, the purpose is to create a reference template for new projects.
So, please, feel free to submit your idea, tips, criticisms, improvements etc etc.
