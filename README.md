# CleanArchitecture.Template
**‚ö†Ô∏è This ReadMe is incomplete! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This is an open source project with the purpose of implement a simple, but complete, Backend Project template using [**Clean Architecture**](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and [**Domain Driven Design**](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/) principles.
My goal is to improve this source code everytime I learn something new about **DDD** and **Clean Architecture** into my everyday job.
So, please, feel free to submit your idea, tips, criticisms, improvements etc etc.

I'm also creating a document to  https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Ov8rARROLX86sz9ilU3XI_azbhVktp_tl1JfdqM3Ws/edit
